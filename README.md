# Course project: MARKETPLACE API, iOS app edition.
This course project was created with a team: we created APIs for the client be able to buy products and the vendor to control the orders.
I was the one responsible for the client-side iOS application.

## This course project was developed with SwiftUI and Combine framework. Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics were used for logging as well.

## Right now, APIs are asleep😴, this means that by running this project on your machine there will be nothing accessible for you. Fortunately, I have a screen recording from the time APIs were still running:

The course project did not ask for the unit and UI tests, though. And they would not work, if I do write them now(API - 😴😴😴)
